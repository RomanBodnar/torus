# Requirements Document

## Introduction

A 3D Tetris-like puzzle game where traditional Tetris pieces (tetrominoes) fall and stack around the surface of a cylindrical tube instead of a flat 2D plane. The game will be built using Three.js for 3D rendering and implemented in TypeScript for type safety and maintainability.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a player, I want to control falling tetromino pieces by rotating the tube beneath them, so that I can position pieces while they maintain their horizontal orientation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new game starts THEN the system SHALL display a 3D cylindrical tube positioned at an angle where its entire circumference is visible to the player
2. WHEN a tetromino piece spawns THEN the system SHALL position it at the top of the tube and allow it to fall downward
3. WHEN the player presses rotation keys THEN the system SHALL rotate the tube around its vertical axis while keeping the tetromino piece in a fixed horizontal orientation
4. WHEN the player presses movement keys THEN the system SHALL rotate the tube left/right or accelerate the piece's downward movement

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a player, I want pieces to stack and form complete rings around the tube, so that I can clear lines and score points like in traditional Tetris.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a tetromino piece reaches the bottom or lands on other pieces THEN the system SHALL lock it in place
2. WHEN a complete horizontal ring is formed around the tube THEN the system SHALL clear that ring and award points
3. WHEN rings are cleared THEN the system SHALL move all pieces above the cleared ring downward
4. WHEN multiple rings are cleared simultaneously THEN the system SHALL award bonus points

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a player, I want the game to increase in difficulty over time, so that the gameplay remains challenging and engaging.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the player clears a certain number of lines THEN the system SHALL increase the falling speed of pieces
2. WHEN the game progresses THEN the system SHALL display the current level and score
3. WHEN pieces stack up to the top of the tube THEN the system SHALL end the game

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a player, I want intuitive 3D controls and visual feedback, so that I can easily understand the game state and control pieces effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the game loads THEN the system SHALL position the camera at an angle that makes the entire circumference of the tube visible to the player
2. WHEN pieces are placed THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback to distinguish placed pieces from the active piece
3. WHEN the player interacts with controls THEN the system SHALL respond immediately with smooth tube rotation animations while keeping tetrominoes horizontally oriented
4. WHEN a piece is about to lock THEN the system SHALL provide visual preview of where it will land
